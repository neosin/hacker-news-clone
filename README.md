- edit posts.

- delete posts.

- upvote posts.

- remove upvote from posts.

- comment on a post.

- edit comments.

- delete comments.

- reply comments.

- delete account along with all posts, upvotes and comments.

- search for posts via title and description.

## Missing

- resetting my password with email.

- and probably many other things.

## Instructions

- First of all, clone this repo from

```sh
git clone https://github.com/simonlindstedt/hacker-news-clone.git
```

- Have [PHP](https://www.php.net/) installed

- Navigate to the root of this directory in your terminal of choice

- Launch a php server from that directory

```sh
php -S localhost:8000
```

- Then open up your web browser och choice and enter localhost:8000 as the URL

- Approach the rest just like a normal website!
